As part of my ongoing effort to build a comprehensive .NET and Azure knowledge base, I’m starting a series of blog posts on each topic in the Fundamentals section. Today, I’m tackling the first topic: comparing the various options available for .NET development.

## Purpose & Organization

The goal of this review is to clarify the landscape of .NET development choices—frameworks, runtimes, and platforms—so I can make informed decisions for future projects. This post is organized to provide:

- A quick summary of the main .NET options
- Key differences and use cases
- My personal takeaways and recommendations

## What I Planned to Do

- Survey the available .NET platforms (Framework, Core, .NET 5+)
- Highlight compatibility, performance, and ecosystem considerations
- Summarize the pros and cons of each option

## Accomplishments

- **Researched** the evolution of .NET, from the original Framework to .NET Core and the unified .NET 5+ platform.
- **Compared** features, platform support, and typical use cases for each option.
- **Documented** the main decision points: legacy support, cross-platform needs, performance, and future-proofing.
- **Created** a reference guide in the documentation for quick comparison.

## Quick Summary

Choosing the right .NET platform depends on your project’s requirements:

- **.NET Framework:** Best for legacy Windows applications, but limited in cross-platform support.
- **.NET Core:** Modern, fast, and cross-platform; ideal for new development.
- **.NET 5/6/7+:** The future of .NET—unified, versatile, and recommended for most scenarios.

I’ve updated the documentation to reflect these insights and will use this guide as a reference for future architecture decisions.

Stay tuned for the next post, where I’ll dive into the .NET Runtime and SDK!
