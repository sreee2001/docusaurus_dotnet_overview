## Purpose & Organization

This post aims to clarify what the .NET Runtime and SDK are, how they interact, and why it matters for developers. I’ll cover:

- Definitions and roles of Runtime vs. SDK
- Installation and versioning tips
- Practical advice for managing environments

## What I Planned to Do

- Distinguish between runtime and SDK
- Explain how each affects development and deployment
- Share best practices for version management

## Accomplishments

- **Defined** the .NET Runtime (execution engine) and SDK (development toolkit).
- **Explained** how the SDK includes compilers, tools, and libraries for building apps.
- **Outlined** strategies for handling multiple versions and avoiding conflicts.
- **Updated** documentation with clear examples and troubleshooting tips.

## Quick Summary

A solid grasp of the .NET Runtime and SDK helps avoid common pitfalls and ensures smooth development workflows. I’ve documented the essentials and practical advice for future reference.

Stay tuned for the next post on the Common Language Infrastructure!
