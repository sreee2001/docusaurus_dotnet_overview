## Idea 1 — Outlook-to-ServiceNow triage agent (SentinelBridge+)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Outlook-to-ServiceNow triage agent (SentinelBridge+)
- Who: IT helpdesks on Microsoft 365 + ServiceNow.
- MVP: Agent that reads a mailbox, classifies, creates/updates tickets, sends Teams notifications.
- Pricing: $300–$1,500/mo per helpdesk; setup fee $1k–$5k.
- Validate: 3 IT teams; measure deflection/MTTA reduction.

### Explain it to me simply (2–4 short passages)

- Think of a smart mail sorter for a company’s IT inbox. When people email “Wi‑Fi broken” or “Deploy this app,” your agent reads the email, understands what it’s about, and opens or updates the right ServiceNow ticket automatically.
- It also messages the right team in Microsoft Teams, so everyone who needs to act gets notified fast. If it’s part of an existing email thread, it adds a comment to the same ticket instead of making a duplicate.
- Over time, it learns common topics like “Trusted Access not working,” “password reset,” or “deployment,” and applies rules (or ML) to set priority and route it correctly. That means less manual triage, faster responses, and fewer lost emails.
- For leaders, it shows simple metrics: how many emails were processed, how many tickets were created/updated, and how much time was saved.

Key terms (very short)

- ServiceNow: a popular IT ticketing system.
- Triage: sorting incoming work by type/priority.
- MTTA: Mean Time To Acknowledge — time until someone starts handling an issue.

### Research, planning, market, and competition (what you can do now)

Research checklist

- Identify 10 target orgs using Microsoft 365 + ServiceNow (mid-market 200–2,000 employees).
- Interview IT helpdesk managers: current email intake process, volume/day, pain points (duplicates, slow response, after-hours).
- Collect baseline metrics: average daily emails, percent converted to tickets, MTTA, duplicate rates, manual errors.
- Confirm must-have features: SSO, audit logs, data residency, change controls, easy rollback, and no-code rules.
- Security review: ask about requirements—least-privilege, secret storage, network egress allowlists, incident handling.

Competitive scan (what exists and gaps)

- ServiceNow Email Inbound Actions
  - Pros: native, stable, configurable by admins.
  - Cons: basic NLP, harder to do thread correlation, limited rich notifications, complex logic becomes brittle.
- Microsoft Power Automate (Flow) + ServiceNow connector
  - Pros: fast to prototype, no-code, built-in M365 auth.
  - Cons: scaling, error handling, NLP quality, complex flows are hard to maintain; per-run costs.
- ServiceNow Virtual Agent / AI Search
  - Pros: advanced within ServiceNow UI; good for chat deflection.
  - Cons: not targeted at email triage; extra licensing, more setup.
- Generic email-to-ticket tools (Freshservice, Zendesk)
  - Pros: mature email intake.
  - Cons: different ecosystem; migration overhead; not great for deep M365/Teams workflows.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Deep Microsoft 365 integration (Graph), Teams notifications, conversation-thread correlation, smarter classification, and rules tailored to each org.
- BYOC-friendly: can run in customer’s Azure tenant (security/compliance wins).
- Observable and auditable with per‑message trace and idempotency (no dupes).

Why this now

- IT helpdesks are flooded with requests; AI + rules can remove repetitive triage, improve response times, and boost employee satisfaction. This is a low-friction purchase if you show time saved and fewer misses.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson voice)

- Target user needs:
  - “Triage is repetitive and error-prone.” “We lose emails or create duplicates.” “Teams wants real-time alerts.” “Leaders want response-time improvements.”
- Market state:
  - Enterprises already use M365 + ServiceNow; existing tools don’t close the gap between email threads, tickets, and Teams workflows with modern AI.
- Current solutions and trade-offs:
  - Native inbound email in ServiceNow works but becomes brittle at scale; Power Automate is easy but hard to maintain with complex logic; full VA/AI modules cost more and aren’t optimized for email threads.
- Your advantage:
  - Purpose-built for Outlook email + ServiceNow with smart dedupe, thread tracking, and Teams notifications. Faster to value, easier to maintain, and runs in their tenant if needed.
- Why build/why try:
  - 2–6 weeks to pilot, no process change for end-users (they still email), and you’ll prove faster MTTA and fewer duplicates in the first month.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] List 20 target companies and 10 personal contacts.
- [ ] Book 6–8 discovery calls (30 min): capture volume/day, current tools, reportable KPIs.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] 80%+ correct classification on top 5 categories
  - [ ] <2% duplicate tickets
  - [ ] MTTA reduction by 20% in 30 days
- [ ] Security must-haves agreed (SSO, audit logs, RBAC).

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Email ingest: Microsoft Graph (poll or webhook) for a single shared mailbox.
- [ ] Classifier: rule-based to start; pluggable interface for LLM later.
- [ ] Ticketing: ServiceNow Table API (create/update/close) + correlation field for Message‑ID.
- [ ] Notifications: Teams webhook posting ticket URL and summary.
- [ ] Observability: request logs, dedupe keys, retry/backoff, dead-letter queue.
- [ ] Settings: appsettings + Key Vault; no secrets in code.
- [ ] Deploy to your Azure subscription for demo; prepare BYOC deployment playbook.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Select 2 design partners (free/discounted pilots).
- [ ] Connect to their test mailbox + dev ServiceNow instance.
- [ ] Run in “shadow mode” (no writes) for 3–5 days; measure classification accuracy.
- [ ] Switch to “write mode” with limited categories; monitor tickets and duplicates daily.
- [ ] Weekly report: MTTA, created/updated tickets, accuracy, top errors.

Phase 3: Pricing and rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Package: Basic ($300/mo), Pro ($800/mo), Enterprise ($1.5k+/mo), setup $1–5k.
- [ ] Contracts: simple order form + DPA template; monthly or annual.
- [ ] Onboarding checklist: mailbox access, ServiceNow integration user, Teams webhook, SSO config.
- [ ] Support runbook: incidents, rollbacks, upgrades; define SLAs.
- [ ] Case study: collect pilot results and quotes.

Simple tracker (columns)

- Company | Contact | M365? | ServiceNow? | Signed Pilot? | Start Date | Daily Volume | MTTA (before/after) | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Slow sales cycle → cashflow risk. Mitigation: start with pilots and clear ROI reports; offer setup fees.
- Cloud costs overrun. Mitigation: BYOC option; cap usage; detailed metering.

Legal/compliance

- Data handling (emails may have PII). Mitigation: data minimization, encryption, audit logs, DPA; run in customer tenant when possible.
- Licensing/ToS: follow Microsoft Graph and ServiceNow terms; use a proper integration user.

Technical

- Misclassification causing wrong routing or spammy tickets. Mitigation: shadow mode, confidence thresholds, human-in-the-loop for low confidence, rollback switch.
- Duplicates/loops. Mitigation: idempotency keys (Message‑ID), processed store, reply heuristics, rate limits.

Operational

- On-call expectations. Mitigation: clear support hours in plan; premium 24/7 as add-on later.

### Glossary (simple)

- BYOC: Bring Your Own Cloud — deploy into the customer’s cloud account.
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control — who can do what.
- DPA: Data Processing Addendum — contract about handling customer data.
- SSO/OIDC/SAML: Single sign-on standards to authenticate users.
- MTTA: Mean Time To Acknowledge — how fast someone starts handling a ticket.
