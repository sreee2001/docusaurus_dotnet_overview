## Idea 20 — Meeting Minutes + Action Items Pipeline (Teams)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Meeting Minutes + Action Items Pipeline (Teams)
- Who: Executives, PMOs, team leads using Microsoft Teams.
- MVP: Capture meeting notes, summarize decisions, extract action items with owners/dates, and sync to Planner/Jira/DevOps with Teams updates.
- Pricing: $10–$30/user/mo or $500–$1,500/team/mo.
- Validate: 10 meetings; accuracy and adoption feedback.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- This tool listens to your meetings, writes clear notes, and lists who needs to do what by when.
- It puts tasks into the tools you already use and reminds people in Teams.
- Less time writing notes, more time doing the work.

Key terms (simple)

- Minutes: The written summary of a meeting.
- Action item: A task with an owner and due date.
- Planner/Jira/Azure DevOps: Tools where tasks are tracked.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 6 PMs/team leads; catalog meeting types (standups, steering, design), current note‑taking, and task tracking flows.
- Baseline: time spent on minutes, missing action items, follow‑through rate.
- Must‑haves: consent handling, role‑based access, tool connectors, and audit trail.

Competitive scan

- Meeting assistants (Otter, Fireflies, Microsoft Copilot)
  - Pros: transcription and summaries.
  - Cons: weak integration with structured action tracking and custom workflows.
- Manual notes + tasks
  - Pros: control.
  - Cons: slow and error‑prone.

Your wedge (advantages)

- High‑quality action extraction with owners/dates plus strong sync with Planner/Jira and Teams reminders.

Why now

- Hybrid work increased meeting load; automating follow‑through is high ROI.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Never lose an action,” “Consistent notes,” “Automatic task sync,” “Less admin time.”
- Market: Transcription is commoditized; structured, tool‑integrated action pipelines remain underserved.
- Why try: Two‑week pilot to cut admin time and raise follow‑through.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Identify top meeting types; define note templates and task destinations.
- [ ] Agree on consent and recording policy.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Teams meeting capture (recording/transcript permissioned); summary; action extraction with confidence.
- [ ] Create tasks in Planner/Jira/ADO; Teams reminders; owner confirmation flow.
- [ ] Dashboard: meetings processed, actions created, follow‑through rate.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] 10 meetings across 2 teams; measure time saved and task closure rate.
- [ ] Iterate extraction rules and reminder cadence.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing per user/team; onboarding and security documentation.
- [ ] Optional: templates per meeting type; integrations for Confluence/SharePoint minutes.

Simple tracker

- Meeting | Date | Summary | Actions | Owners | Due | Synced? | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: perceived as a “nice‑to‑have” → quantify time saved and task completion improvements.
- Legal: recording/transcript permissions → consent prompts and retention controls.
- Technical: action extraction accuracy → human confirm on low‑confidence items.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Consent: Participants agree to recording and processing.
- Confidence: How sure the system is about the extracted action.
- Follow‑through: Percent of actions completed on time.

### Confirm to proceed (unattended mode)

Continuing unattended in Normal mode.
