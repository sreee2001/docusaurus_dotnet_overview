## Idea 22 — RAG Infra in Customer Cloud (BYOC)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- RAG Infra in Customer Cloud (BYOC)
- Who: Data/legal/knowledge teams needing privacy.
- MVP: Deploy vector DB + retrievers + ingestion pipelines in AKS/EKS with IaC, monitoring, and SSO.
- Pricing: $2,000 setup + $1,000–$3,000/mo; services for migration.
- Validate: One corpus live with measurable retrieval quality and latency.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- This sets up the “brain” for AI to answer questions about your documents, inside your cloud.
- It loads and organizes files so the AI can find the right facts and answer accurately.

Key terms (simple)

- RAG: Retrieval‑Augmented Generation, where AI looks up facts before answering.
- Vector DB: A database that finds similar text quickly.
- IaC: Infrastructure as Code, scripts that set up cloud resources reliably.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 4 teams; identify data sources (SharePoint/OneDrive/Confluence/SQL), privacy needs, and SSO.
- Baseline: current Q&A accuracy and latency, doc freshness.
- Must‑haves: connectors, chunking/tuning, RBAC, monitoring, rollback.

Competitive scan

- Managed RAG platforms
  - Pros: speed to start.
  - Cons: data residency/control concerns.
- DIY stacks
  - Pros: control.
  - Cons: maintenance heavy; missing guardrails.

Your wedge (advantages)

- BYOC with strong connectors, guardrails, IaC, and dashboards; opinionated defaults that work.

Why now

- Privacy and compliance needs push RAG into customer clouds.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Control data,” “Good answers,” “Easy ops,” “SSO and audit.”
- Market: Many tools; few turnkey BYOC stacks with enterprise guardrails.
- Why try: 2–3 week deployment to first useful corpus, with measurable quality.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Inventory sources and access; define success metrics (precision@k, latency).
- [ ] Choose vector DB and ingestion cadence.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] IaC for AKS/EKS; vector DB; retrievers; ingestion workers; observability.
- [ ] Connectors (SharePoint/OneDrive/S3/Confluence/SQL); SSO and RBAC.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Ingest one corpus; measure quality/latency; tune chunking and prompts.
- [ ] Build dashboards and alerting; document operations.

Phase 3: Rollout (ongoing)

- [ ] Pricing as above; support SLAs; optional hybrid search integration.

Simple tracker

- Source | Docs | Freshness | Precision | Latency | Issues | Owner | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: sticker shock → start with a small cluster and clear ROI.
- Legal: data residency and access → BYOC, encryption, RBAC, audit.
- Technical: connectors and drift → prioritize M365 connectors and monitoring.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- RBAC: Who can access what.
- Precision@k: How many of the top k results are relevant.
- Chunking: Splitting documents into useful pieces.
