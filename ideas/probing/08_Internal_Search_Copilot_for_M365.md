## Idea 8 — Internal Search Copilot for M365 (permissions-aware hybrid search)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Internal Search Copilot for M365 (permissions-aware hybrid search)
- Who: Information-heavy orgs on Microsoft 365 (SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams), possibly Confluence/Jira, with strict access controls.
- MVP: Ask a question and get an answer with citations across SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams (and optionally Confluence), respecting permissions; Teams bot + web UI.
- Pricing: $1,000–$3,000/mo.
- Validate: 10 users; measure search success rate and time saved.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Imagine a smart “company Google” that knows which files you’re allowed to see and answers your question directly with links to the source pages.
- It searches across SharePoint sites, OneDrive folders, Teams files, and optionally Confluence, then summarizes the best bits so you don’t click 10 links.
- If you don’t have permission, it won’t show the content. It respects your company’s security rules.
- You can use it in Teams like a chat, or in a simple web page. It’s fast help for “Where’s the latest policy?” or “What’s the deployment guide?”

Key terms (simple)

- Permissions-aware: Only content you can access is considered or shown.
- Hybrid search: Searching multiple sources (SharePoint, OneDrive, Confluence) together.
- Citations: Links back to the exact files/sections used.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 orgs with large SharePoint sprawl (100+ sites) and frequent “Where is X?” pain.
- Interview IT/Knowledge Managers: current search complaints, security needs (sensitivity labels), multi-language, mobile usage, who owns content quality.
- Baseline metrics: search success rate, average time to find a doc, top query categories.
- Confirm must‑haves: SSO (Azure AD), sensitivity labels handling, tenant restrictions, citations, Teams bot, admin controls.

Competitive scan

- Microsoft Search/Copilot (M365)
  - Pros: native, improving rapidly, great integration.
  - Cons: limited custom control on retrieval/ranking; hard to add Confluence/Jira deeply; limited admin analytics.
- Confluence/Jira Search + apps
  - Pros: tailored to Atlassian.
  - Cons: weak across M365 files; permission mapping gaps.
- Custom RAG bots
  - Pros: flexible.
  - Cons: permissions and sync are hard; admin analytics missing.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Strong permission sync for M365 plus optional Confluence connector; clear admin analytics (top misses, stale docs) and governance knobs.
- Teams-first UX with citations; content freshness checks; optional BYOC indexing.

Why now

- Knowledge is scattered across M365; users waste time hunting. LLM RAG is good enough now—if permissions and freshness are handled correctly.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Find the right doc fast,” “Respect permissions,” “See sources,” “Spot stale/duplicate content.”
- Market state: Native search gets better, but enterprises need cross‑tool retrieval and admin insights; few tools do both well for M365‑first shops.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Native is simple but limited; custom is powerful but high maintenance. You provide managed control with solid governance.
- Why try it: In two weeks, we’ll index your top sites and show faster answers with citations and admin insights into your knowledge gaps.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Locate 10 candidate departments with heavy SharePoint usage.
- [ ] Baseline: top 50 queries; time‑to‑doc; sensitive content rules; languages.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] ≥ 60% “useful answer” rate with citations
  - [ ] Average time‑to‑answer under 10 seconds
  - [ ] Zero permission leaks in test set
- [ ] Confirm admin analytics and governance requirements.

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Connectors & sync:
  - [ ] Microsoft Graph for SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams files (metadata + permissions)
  - [ ] Optional Confluence connector with group mapping
  - [ ] Incremental sync & freshness checks; deduping
- [ ] Indexing & retrieval:
  - [ ] Chunking + embeddings; per‑document ACL metadata
  - [ ] RAG with citations; language detection; reranking
- [ ] UX:
  - [ ] Teams bot: ask/answer with links; follow‑ups
  - [ ] Web UI: search box + answer + sources; copy/share functions
- [ ] Admin & governance:
  - [ ] Analytics (top queries, misses, stale docs)
  - [ ] Blocklists/allowlists; sensitivity label rules
  - [ ] SSO/RBAC, audit logs, retention controls

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Index 10–20 top sites and a Confluence space; run user tests.
- [ ] Validate permission‑aware behavior with test users.
- [ ] Weekly report: answer usefulness, time‑to‑answer, top misses, stale/duplicate content map.
- [ ] Iterate: improve chunking, ranking, and freshness policies.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing tiers: Starter ($1k/mo) for M365 only; Pro ($2k/mo) adds Confluence; Enterprise ($3k+/mo) adds BYOC + advanced governance.
- [ ] Onboarding: tenant consent, site scopes, sensitivity rules, Teams bot install, admin dashboard.
- [ ] Security docs: data flows, permission sync details, retention, DPA.
- [ ] Case study: time saved, user satisfaction, stale content reduced.

Simple tracker (columns)

- Department | Sites indexed | Confluence? | Useful answer % | Time‑to‑answer | Stale pages flagged | Incidents | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Perceived overlap with Microsoft Copilot/Search.
  - Mitigation: emphasize permission diagnostics, cross‑tool retrieval, admin analytics, and governance features.

Legal/compliance

- Sensitive files exposure via mis‑synced permissions.
  - Mitigation: permission sync tests, deny‑by‑default, audit trails, frequent incremental sync.

Technical

- Freshness and dedup complexity.
  - Mitigation: change feeds, recrawl schedules, duplicate clustering, source of truth preferences.
- Cost and latency when indexing large sites.
  - Mitigation: staged rollouts, batched indexing, tiered storage; BYOC for heavy loads.

Operational

- Content quality problems blamed on search.
  - Mitigation: surface stale/duplicate reports; work with content owners; provide edit queues.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Sensitivity labels: Tags that mark how confidential a document is and who can see it.
- Reranking: A second pass that reorders results to improve relevance.
- Incremental sync: Update only what changed since last time, not everything.
