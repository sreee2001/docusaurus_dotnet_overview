## Idea 18 — Marketing Asset Request Bot

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Marketing Asset Request Bot
- Who: Marketing operations teams.
- MVP: Intake creative briefs via email/Forms, route to designers/writers, auto‑acknowledge, track status, and provide Teams updates.
- Pricing: $500–$1,500/mo.
- Validate: Time‑to‑first‑draft and on‑time delivery improvement for one team.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Marketers get many requests for graphics, PDFs, videos, and blog posts. This bot collects the requests, fills in missing details, and sends them to the right person.
- It keeps everyone in the loop with status updates and due dates, reducing back‑and‑forth emails.
- It can draft simple briefs and checklists so the team starts faster and finishes on time.

Key terms (simple)

- Creative brief: A short document describing what to make, for whom, and by when.
- Asset: Any marketing deliverable, like a logo, banner, or case study.
- SLA: Target time for draft/review.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 5 marketing ops leads; list top asset types, intake pain points, current tooling (Asana/Jira/Trello/Smartsheet), and SLAs.
- Baseline: time from request to first draft, revisions count, overdue rate.
- Must‑haves: form/email intake, attachments, approvals, brand guidelines links.

Competitive scan

- Project tools (Asana/Jira/Trello)
  - Pros: task tracking.
  - Cons: intake quality and automation vary, Teams integration often basic.
- Shared mailbox + spreadsheets
  - Pros: simple.
  - Cons: missing fields, lost context, poor analytics.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Intake‑first, high‑quality briefs with automation and Teams updates; plugs into existing tools rather than replacing them.

Why now

- Content volume is rising; small teams need better intake without heavy PM overhead.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Better briefs,” “Fewer back‑and‑forths,” “On‑time delivery,” “Visibility.”
- Market: PM tools exist but don’t solve intake quality and stakeholder updates; your bot does.
- Why try: Two‑week pilot to show faster first drafts and fewer revisions.
