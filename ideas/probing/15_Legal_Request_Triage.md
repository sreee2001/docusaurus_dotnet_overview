## Idea 15 — Legal Request Triage (Matter Intake)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Legal Request Triage (Matter Intake)
- Who: In‑house legal teams.
- MVP: Classify legal requests (NDA, DPA, contract review, trademark), route to the right counsel, create tickets, and track SLAs.
- Pricing: $1,000–$3,000/mo.
- Validate: 2 departments; SLA adherence.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Legal inboxes get many types of requests. This tool reads each email, figures out what it is, and sends it to the right lawyer or queue.
- It creates a simple ticket, tracks deadlines, and posts updates in Teams.
- It can draft standard replies (e.g., “Here’s our NDA template”), speeding simple tasks.
- Leaders get visibility into load and turnaround times.

Key terms (simple)

- NDA/DPA: Standard agreements for confidentiality and data processing.
- SLA: Target time to respond/complete.
- Matter: A legal case or task to track.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 8 legal teams; document top request types, current trackers (SharePoint/Jira), SLAs, and escalations.
- Baseline: volume/week, response times, stuck items.
- Must‑haves: privilege awareness, confidentiality handling, approval flows.

Competitive scan

- Legal ticketing/matter tools (SimpleLegal, Jira + templates)
  - Pros: structure.
  - Cons: email intake and classification weak; Teams integration minimal.
- Shared inboxes + spreadsheets
  - Pros: simple.
  - Cons: poor tracking and routing; no analytics.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Email‑first triage with strong templates, Teams integration, and SLA tracking; integrates with existing tools.

Why now

- Legal workloads are rising; small teams need automation without heavy platforms.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Route fast,” “Standardize,” “Hit SLAs,” “Visibility.”
- Market: Platforms exist but are heavy; DIY lacks automation. You bridge the gap.
- Why try: 2‑week pilot to show response‑time gains and fewer dropped requests.

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: small teams churn → bundle templates and reporting.
- Legal: privilege/Confidential info → strict access and audit; avoid storing payloads.
- Technical: classification errors → human review for low confidence.

### Glossary (simple)

- Privilege: Confidential attorney‑client communications.
- Escalation: Move a task to higher priority or senior counsel.
- Backlog: Work items not yet completed.
