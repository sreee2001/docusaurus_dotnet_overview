Got it. I’ll deliver the next idea in the same structure as Idea 1, then list the next 5 candidates so you can choose what follows.

## Idea 2 — Teams Incident Commander Bot

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Teams Incident Commander Bot
- Who: DevOps/IT/SRE teams using Microsoft Teams.
- MVP: Bot to declare incidents, assemble channels, run checklists, open tickets, capture timeline.
- Pricing: $300–$2,000/mo.
- Validate: 3 incidents across 2 teams.

Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Imagine a “coach” that shows up in your Teams chat the moment an outage starts. You type “/incident start,” and it creates a dedicated channel, invites the right people, posts the checklist, and opens the ticket automatically.
- As folks chat, the bot keeps a clean timeline: who did what and when. It nudges people for updates, tracks action items, and shares the ticket link and status in one place.
- When the issue is fixed, the bot closes the loop: it collects a short summary, gathers postmortem notes, and shares the final status with stakeholders. No more messy copy-paste or lost steps.
- For leaders, it reduces noise and delays. For engineers, it removes busywork so they can focus on fixing.

Key terms

- Incident: An unplanned interruption or reduction in service quality.
- SRE: Site Reliability Engineering — practices to keep systems reliable.
- Postmortem: A review after an incident to learn and prevent repeat issues.

Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 15–20 Teams-first orgs (200–2,000 employees) with on-call rotations.
- Interview SRE/IT managers: current incident flow, tools (PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Jira/ServiceNow), pain points (slow war-room setup, poor timelines, compliance reporting).
- Baseline metrics: time to assemble responders, MTTA (acknowledge), MTTM (mitigation), postmortem turnaround time.
- Confirm integrations: ServiceNow or Jira, PagerDuty/Opsgenie, Statuspage/Communication channels.
- Security/compliance needs: audit logs, role-based access, change controls.

Competitive scan

- PagerDuty Incident Workflows/Slack bot
  - Pros: deep incident orchestration, mature ecosystem.
  - Cons: Slack-first; Teams support varies; higher price; can be heavy for mid-market.
- Atlassian/Jira Service Management
  - Pros: ticket-driven incidents, runbooks, CMDB ties.
  - Cons: Not Teams-native; setup overhead; timeline tracking can be manual.
- Microsoft Teams + Power Automate templates
  - Pros: quick to hack; low-code.
  - Cons: brittle at scale, limited timeline capture, poor auditability and runbook depth.
- Custom bots/org scripts
  - Pros: tailored; integrates with internal systems.
  - Cons: maintenance burden; inconsistent UX; lacks polish.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Teams-native, low-friction UX; fast spin-up of incident channels and roles.
- Opinionated, yet configurable runbook with automatic timeline capture and postmortem scaffolding.
- Smooth ServiceNow integration (reuse your SentinelBridge patterns) and optional BYOC deployment in customer Azure.

Why now

- Teams is dominant in many enterprises; most polished incident tooling is Slack-first. A Teams-first, light, affordable orchestrator is under-served.

A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “We waste 10–20 minutes assembling people.” “Our timelines are messy.” “Leaders want clear comms.” “Auditors want consistent evidence.”
- Market state: Strong solutions exist but are Slack/Jira-first or heavy-weight. Teams-native, mid-market friendly solutions are fewer.
- Pros/cons of current options: Powerful but complex vs. simple but brittle. You provide the middle path: fast, reliable, Teams-first, and auditable.
- Your advantage: Opinionated defaults (90% use-cases) with plug-ins for ITSM and on-call tools; clean timeline and easy postmortems.
- Why try it: Prove you can shave 10–15 minutes off response time and produce audit-ready timelines with zero process change.

Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] List 20 Teams-first orgs, prioritize those with PagerDuty/Opsgenie + ServiceNow/Jira.
- [ ] Book 6–8 discovery calls; capture incident volume/month, current orchestration, what “good” looks like.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Channel created + roles assigned under 60 seconds
  - [ ] Timeline entries auto-captured (≥80% of key events)
  - [ ] Postmortem template generated within 5 minutes of close
- [ ] Confirm required integrations and access model (bot permissions, ITSM API user).

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Teams bot (Azure Bot Framework) with commands: /incident start, /status, /summary, /close.
- [ ] Channel orchestration: create Team/Channel (or reuse a “War Room” Team), add responders by role.
- [ ] Checklist/runbook: load from YAML; post steps and track completion.
- [ ] Timeline engine: capture joins, command invocations, ticket updates; allow “/note <text>”.
- [ ] ITSM integration: create/update incident in ServiceNow/Jira; post links.
- [ ] Storage: Postgres/Blob for timelines and artifacts; export as Markdown/PDF.
- [ ] Security: SSO (Azure AD), RBAC for commands, audit logs.
- [ ] Observability: logs, metrics (time to channel, time to first response), error alerts.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Choose 2–3 design partners; run in sandbox first.
- [ ] Dry-run game days; measure setup time and user feedback.
- [ ] Real incidents: shadow mode for one week to validate; then enable writes.
- [ ] Weekly report: MTTA/MTTM deltas, checklist completion rates, timeline completeness, user feedback.
- [ ] Iterate: shortcuts, role mapping, better summaries.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing tiers: Basic ($300/mo), Pro ($800/mo with ITSM + on-call), Enterprise ($2k+/mo with SSO/RBAC/audit export).
- [ ] Onboarding: app registration for bot, permissions, ITSM credentials, role mapping CSV, runbook templates.
- [ ] Support runbook & SLA: define expectations; premium 24/7 as add-on.
- [ ] Security docs: data flow, retention, least privilege.
- [ ] Case study and testimonial from pilots.

Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Low incident volume may reduce perceived ROI. Mitigation: price on time saved; bundle with triage product; offer entry-level pricing.

Legal/compliance

- Chat content retention/auditing requirements. Mitigation: configurable retention; export to customer storage; clear DPA and data residency options.

Technical

- Bot permissions and tenant consent hurdles. Mitigation: clear setup guide, admin-consent flows, least-privilege scopes.
- Noisy channels and false positives. Mitigation: simple guardrails, rate-limits, and easy “/close” with summary prompts.

Operational

- On-call expectations for your support. Mitigation: standard support hours initially; premium support as upsell.

Glossary (simple)

- Azure Bot Framework: Microsoft’s platform to build Teams bots.
- Runbook: A step-by-step procedure to handle incidents.
- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control — who is allowed to run commands.
