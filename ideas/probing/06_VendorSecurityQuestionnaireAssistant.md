## Idea 6 — Vendor Security Questionnaire Assistant (RAG over policies, draft answers)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Vendor Security Questionnaire Assistant (RAG over policies, draft answers)
- Who: Startups and mid‑market vendors selling to enterprise; Security/Compliance/Legal teams; Sales Engineering.
- MVP: Retrieval‑augmented (RAG) assistant over your security policies, controls, audits, and past answers that drafts responses to SIG/CAIQ/custom spreadsheets with citations and confidence.
- Pricing: $2,000 per questionnaire or $500–$2,000/mo subscription (plus pro services for setup).
- Validate: Complete 2 real questionnaires with ≥80% draft coverage and <15% corrections by the security lead.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Big companies send long security forms (hundreds of questions) before they buy from you. Filling them by hand takes days. This tool reads your existing policy docs and past answers, and then suggests completed answers automatically.
- It shows where each answer came from (a document and section), gives a confidence score, and flags tricky questions for a human. You review, tweak, and export a clean, branded response.
- Over time, it learns your preferred wording and what each customer cares about. It also keeps evidence (like SOC2 reports) organized so you don’t hunt for files.
- Result: faster deals, fewer mistakes, and less stress for Security, Legal, and Sales.

Key terms (simple)

- RAG: The model looks up relevant documents first and uses them to write answers.
- SIG/CAIQ: Standard security questionnaires used by many enterprises.
- TPRM: Third‑Party Risk Management—how buyers assess vendor risk.
- SOC2/ISO 27001: Common security audit standards/evidence your customers ask about.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 companies that regularly face security questionnaires (B2B SaaS, healthcare tech, fintech). Ask: volume per quarter, average turnaround time, blockers.
- Inventory documents: policies, procedures, network diagrams (sanitized), SOC2, pen test reports, DPIA/DPA templates, previous questionnaires, “Trust” website content.
- Define success metrics: % auto‑filled, % corrections required, cycle time reduction (days), win‑rate lift (deals unblocked).
- Confirm constraints: data sensitivity, retention, reviewers, approval flows (Security → Legal → Sales).

Competitive scan (high‑level)

- Trust portals/TPRM platforms (Whistic, Conveyor, OneTrust, SecurityScorecard)
  - Pros: standardized sharing; some AI‑assisted answers.
  - Cons: may require buyers to use the platform; mixed RAG quality; setup time; cost.
- Compliance automation (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, Hyperproof)
  - Pros: strong evidence collection; controls mapping.
  - Cons: questionnaire answering is improving but often generic; requires deeper program adoption.
- Manual playbooks and wikis
  - Pros: control; tailored.
  - Cons: slow; error‑prone; hard to keep up to date.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Your content, your voice: RAG grounded in the company’s own policies, past answers, and evidence—permission‑aware.
- Reviewer‑first workflow: confidence scoring, citations, red flags, and change tracking to speed reviews.
- BYOC option: index and inference in the customer’s cloud (compliance‑friendly); exports to buyer formats (Excel/portal).

Why now

- Enterprise buyers are accelerating TPRM, and teams are questionnaire‑burdened. LLMs plus RAG can safely draft 60–90% of answers if grounded and reviewed, cutting days from sales cycles.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Get questionnaires back in days, not weeks,” “Stop chasing evidence,” “Keep responses consistent and defensible,” “Protect sensitive docs.”
- Market state: Many platforms; few deliver high‑precision drafts with citations and reviewer workflows without forcing a new portal on buyers.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Trust portals help share docs but still require manual writing; compliance tools collect evidence but aren’t optimized for questionnaire language or buyer‑specific formats.
- Your advantage: Email/Excel/portal‑agnostic export, reviewer‑friendly RAG with sources and confidence, and optional BYOC deployment for strict teams.
- Why try it: In the first 2 questionnaires, we’ll show 70–90% draft coverage and cut turnaround by 50–70%.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Identify 8–10 prospects who handled ≥4 questionnaires in the last 6 months.
- [ ] Interviews (Security/Legal/SalesOps): volume, average size, current tools, rejection reasons, reviewers and SLAs.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance:
  - [ ] ≥70% auto‑filled draft with citations
  - [ ] ≤15% content edits by Security
  - [ ] Export fits buyer format (Excel/portal copy‑paste)
- [ ] Data boundaries agreed (retention, redaction, region, BYOC option).

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Document ingestion
  - [ ] Connect sources (SharePoint/Confluence/Drive/Git repo); chunk, classify (policy, control, evidence, prior answers).
  - [ ] Create embeddings with metadata (doc, section, date, sensitivity tag, ACL).
- [ ] Questionnaire parser
  - [ ] Import Excel/CSV or portal export; normalize question IDs and categories.
  - [ ] Map synonyms (e.g., “Do you encrypt data at rest?” → “At-rest encryption”).
- [ ] Drafting engine
  - [ ] RAG prompt that cites top passages; answer style templates (short, long, formal).
  - [ ] Confidence scoring; flag risky items (legal, privacy, architecture).
- [ ] Reviewer workflow
  - [ ] Side‑by‑side view: draft + sources; accept/edit; comment and assign.
  - [ ] Change log and final export (Excel + PDF with appendix of sources).
- [ ] Safety/compliance
  - [ ] PII redaction in logs; access controls; retention policy.
  - [ ] BYOC indexing option; configurable data region.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Run on 2 real questionnaires (one standard like CAIQ, one custom).
- [ ] Track: % auto‑filled, edit rate, cycle time, reviewer satisfaction.
- [ ] Build a “golden answer library” from accepted answers; add style glossary.
- [ ] Iterate: improve parser mappings, templates, and flagged categories.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing: Per‑questionnaire ($2k) or subscription ($1k–$2k/mo) with limits (question count, users), plus onboarding.
- [ ] Onboarding: sources, confidentiality flags, templates, reviewer roles, retention settings.
- [ ] Security docs: data flows, BYOC option, DPA; admin controls for purge/export.
- [ ] Case study: time saved, acceptance rates, win‑rate improvement.

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Low questionnaire volume → slower ROI. Mitigation: per‑questionnaire pricing; bundle with Trust page kits or audit evidence management.
- Heavy onboarding. Mitigation: starter templates; prioritized doc list; “good‑enough” pass to show value before deep indexing.

Legal/compliance

- Sensitive documents (pen test reports, architecture). Mitigation: strict access controls, redaction, BYOC option, short retention, encrypted storage, DPA.
- Incorrect answers leading to misrepresentation. Mitigation: human‑in‑the‑loop required; approval gates; citations; disclaimers until approved.

Technical

- Poor doc quality/outdated policies. Mitigation: freshness checks; “staleness” badges; update prompts; maintain a delta queue.
- Custom buyer portals. Mitigation: flexible export (Excel/CSV/Markdown), and a copy‑helper with formatting.

Operational

- Reviewer bottlenecks. Mitigation: assign by category; SLAs; daily digest; pre‑approved answer blocks.

### Glossary (simple)

- Evidence: Documents that prove a security control exists (e.g., SOC2 report).
- Citation: The source doc and section used to support an answer.
- BYOC: Run the index and model inside the customer’s cloud account.
