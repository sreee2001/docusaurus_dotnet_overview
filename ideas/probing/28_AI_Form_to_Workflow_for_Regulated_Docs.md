## Idea 28 — AI Form‑to‑Workflow for Regulated Docs

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- AI Form‑to‑Workflow for Regulated Docs
- Who: Compliance‑heavy orgs (healthcare, finance, public sector).
- MVP: Parse forms (PDF/Word) into structured data with validations and route to approvals in Teams/Power Automate.
- Pricing: $1,000–$4,000/mo.
- Validate: One form type end‑to‑end with high extraction accuracy and cycle‑time reduction.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Many regulated forms are still PDFs and Word docs. This tool reads them and fills a clean system with the right fields.
- It validates and routes for approvals so fewer errors slip through.

Key terms (simple)

- OCR: Turning scanned images into text.
- Validation: Checks that data looks correct (e.g., date formats).
- Workflow: The steps to review and approve something.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 5 compliance owners; pick one high‑impact form; capture format variants and approval steps.
- Baseline: extraction accuracy, rework rate, cycle time.
- Must‑haves: field mapping, validations, exceptions, audit trail.

Competitive scan

- OCR/IDP vendors
  - Pros: extraction strength.
  - Cons: limited workflow and Teams integration.
- Manual processes
  - Pros: control.
  - Cons: slow, error‑prone.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Opinionated mapping + validations + Teams routing; integrates with Power Automate and Line‑of‑Business apps.

Why now

- Pressure to digitize; LLMs improve accuracy when combined with rules.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Accurate extraction,” “Fewer errors,” “Faster approvals,” “Audit ready.”
- Market: Many IDP tools; few are turnkey with Teams/Power Automate flows.
- Why try: Pilot a single form to show measurable accuracy and time savings.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Choose the form and systems of record; define validations and approvers.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Parser for form variants; LLM+rules extraction; confidence per field.
- [ ] Exception queue; Teams notifications; approvals; data export/API.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Measure accuracy and cycle time; tune mappings and validations.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $1k–$4k/mo; onboarding and security docs.
- [ ] Optional: document generation for reply letters.

Simple tracker

- Form | Fields | Accuracy | Exceptions | Owner | SLA | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: scope creep → narrow to one form and expand later.
- Legal: PII/PHI → redaction, encryption, BYOC.
- Technical: form variety → progressive mapping and templates.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- IDP: Intelligent Document Processing.
- PHI: Protected health information.
- SLA: Service‑level agreement, a response/processing target.
