## Idea 31 — Data Loss Prevention for Agent Tools

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Data Loss Prevention for Agent Tools
- Who: Security/platform teams exposing tools to agents.
- MVP: Policy engine to allow/deny tool use, secret masking, output scrubbing, and full audit of tool calls.
- Pricing: $1,000–$3,000/mo.
- Validate: Pilot with a few tools; zero policy violations; useful audits.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Agents can call tools like “search email” or “download file.” This layer controls which tools can be used and what data gets out.
- It masks secrets and keeps a record of every call so you can trace what happened.

Key terms (simple)

- Tool: An external action an agent can take.
- DLP: Data Loss Prevention—stop sensitive info from leaving.
- Scrubbing: Removing or masking sensitive content.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 5 teams with agents; list tools, data types, and current guardrails.
- Baseline: incidents/near misses; existing policies.
- Must‑haves: per‑tool policies, context filters, secrets masking, audit, block pages.

Competitive scan

- API gateways
  - Pros: control plane.
  - Cons: not agent‑aware; lacks content scrubbing.
- General DLP
  - Pros: policy concepts.
  - Cons: not integrated with agent tool semantics.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Agent‑aware policies (intent/context), content scrubbing, and explainable blocks.

Why now

- Tool‑using agents are rising; unguarded tools risk exfiltration.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Prevent leaks,” “Enforce policy,” “See what happened,” “Don’t break dev velocity.”
- Market: Gaps between agent stacks and enterprise DLP; you bridge them.
- Why try: Pilot with real tools; show zero leaks and good logs.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Inventory tools and data classes; define policies.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Policy engine; secret masking; output scrubbing; audit store.
- [ ] SDK for enforcement hooks; dashboards; alerting.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Wrap 3–5 tools; test policy hits and dev feedback.

Phase 3: Rollout (ongoing)

- [ ] Pricing as above; onboarding; BYOC option.

Simple tracker

- Tool | Policy | Hits | Blocks | Masked items | Owner | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: perceived friction → highlight incidents avoided.
- Legal: logging sensitive data → redact; BYOC.
- Technical: false positives → allow overrides and feedback.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Intent: What the agent is trying to do.
- Override: Allow a block with justification.
- Audit: A record of what happened.

### Confirm to proceed (unattended mode)

Continuing unattended in Normal mode.
