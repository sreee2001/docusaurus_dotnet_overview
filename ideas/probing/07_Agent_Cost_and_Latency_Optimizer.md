## Idea 7 — Agent Cost & Latency Optimizer (A/B routing, caching, budget caps)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Agent Cost & Latency Optimizer (A/B routing, caching, budget caps)
- Who: AI platform teams and app teams running LLM/agent workloads.
- MVP: Routing between providers/models, caching, budget caps, and latency SLOs with dashboards and guardrails.
- Pricing: $1,000–$4,000/mo.
- Validate: 30% cost drop and/or p95 latency cut in one pilot workload.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Imagine you’re choosing the fastest, cheapest route for every message your app sends to an AI model. Sometimes Model A is cheaper. Sometimes Model B is faster. Your optimizer picks the best option automatically.
- It also remembers answers. If someone asks the same thing again (or something very similar), it can return the cached answer instantly, saving time and money.
- You set simple rules like “stay under $X/day” or “never exceed 1 second for 95% of requests,” and the system enforces those rules—throttling non‑critical work or switching to a cheaper model when needed.
- Think of it like cruise control for AI costs and speed: smooth, safe, and efficient without constant manual tuning.

Key terms (simple)

- A/B routing: Trying two or more providers/models and picking the winner by cost/latency/quality.
- p95 latency: 95% of requests finish faster than this time—good for UX commitments.
- Cache: Save past answers to reuse; can be exact match or semantic (similar question → reuse answer).
- SLO: Service Level Objective—your target for reliability/latency.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 teams that spend $5k+/mo on LLMs or run latency‑sensitive agents (support bots, search, analytics).
- Interview dev leads: current providers (Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, local vLLM), latency goals, peak times, regions, caching today, budget ownership.
- Gather baseline metrics: average and p95 latency, monthly cost by model/provider, cache hit rate (if any), timeout/error rates.
- Confirm must‑haves: SSO/RBAC, audit logs, safe prompt handling (no secrets in logs), multi‑region, BYOC option for on‑prem/AKS.

Competitive scan

- Native provider features (Azure OpenAI tokens, usage caps, retry/backoff)
  - Pros: simple, integrated.
  - Cons: single‑provider; limited cross‑provider routing; basic budgets.
- Model routers/LLM ops tools (various open source/commercial)
  - Pros: quick start; some have built‑in caching and evals.
  - Cons: uneven policy controls; weak budget governance; limited enterprise SSO/RBAC.
- DIY routing + CDN‑style cache
  - Pros: fully tailored.
  - Cons: high maintenance; edge‑cases (drift, safety) get complex; no turnkey budget caps.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Enterprise‑grade guardrails (budgets, RBAC, audit) plus pragmatic optimizations (semantic cache, dynamic routing). Azure‑first support and BYOC runtime in customer cloud if needed.
- Real SLO control: switch routes or degrade gracefully when p95 drifts; protect critical paths while throttling non‑critical ones.

Why now

- AI bills and latency are rising with usage. Small changes in routing and caching can save 20–50% and improve UX immediately—without changing app code much.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Lower LLM costs now,” “Hit latency targets consistently,” “Avoid provider lock‑in,” “Budget guardrails that don’t break prod.”
- Market state: Many point tools; few combine cross‑provider routing, semantic cache, budgets, and SLO enforcement with enterprise controls.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Single‑provider simplicity vs. higher cost/latency; DIY flexibility vs. high ops burden. You deliver smart defaults with strong governance.
- Why try it: In a one‑week pilot, we’ll demonstrate cost savings and/or latency improvements on a real endpoint and provide a clear before/after report.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Select 10 candidate teams with measurable LLM traffic (RPS ≥ 1, monthly cost ≥ $3k).
- [ ] Baseline: collect current latency (avg/p95), error/timeout rates, monthly spend by provider/model, and QPS.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] ≥ 20% cost reduction OR ≥ 20% p95 latency reduction
  - [ ] No increase in error rate beyond 1% absolute
  - [ ] Budget cap and alerting verified in staging
- [ ] Security must‑haves: SSO/RBAC, secrets vault, no sensitive prompts in logs, audit trail.

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Routing layer (SDK/gateway):
  - [ ] Providers: Azure OpenAI (primary), OpenAI/Anthropic (optional), local vLLM (optional)
  - [ ] Policies: route by price/latency target; fallback chains; provider health checks
- [ ] Caching:
  - [ ] Exact cache by prompt hash with TTL
  - [ ] Semantic cache (embeddings) with similarity threshold and TTL
  - [ ] Cache bypass for PII/sensitive prompts (policy tags)
- [ ] Budgets & guardrails:
  - [ ] Daily/monthly budgets per app/team; soft (alerts) and hard (throttle/switch/deny) modes
  - [ ] Rate limits by key/app; circuit breaker on sustained failures
- [ ] Observability:
  - [ ] Per‑route metrics (cost per 1k tokens, latency, error rate, cache hit rate)
  - [ ] Dashboards (Grafana/Power BI) + alerts (Teams/Email)
  - [ ] Request correlation IDs; redaction policy for logs
- [ ] SSO/RBAC and config:
  - [ ] Roles (Admin/Owner/Reader); per‑app configs; Key Vault/Secrets Manager

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Integrate gateway/SDK with 1–2 endpoints in staging, then production with a traffic slice (5–20%).
- [ ] Enable exact cache first; measure hit rate; then layer semantic cache.
- [ ] Turn on budget alerts; verify throttles only for non‑critical flows.
- [ ] Weekly report: cost/latency before vs after; cache hit rate; provider health incidents; savings estimate.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing tiers: Starter ($1k/mo), Pro ($2.5k/mo), Enterprise ($4k+/mo) with SSO/RBAC, BYOC, multi‑region, and support SLAs.
- [ ] Onboarding checklist: providers/regions, keys/secrets, budget tiers, latency targets, cache policy, fallback order.
- [ ] Security docs: data flow, redaction, key management, audit retention; DPA.
- [ ] Case study: % savings and p95 improvement with methodology.

Simple tracker (columns)

- App/Team | RPS | Monthly cost | p95 baseline | Target p95 | Cache hit % | Budget cap | Savings % | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Savings vary by workload—may disappoint some teams.
  - Mitigation: run a short bake‑off to estimate potential; focus on endpoints with high spend.

Legal/compliance

- Data sharing with multiple providers.
  - Mitigation: policy tags, provider allowlist, redaction, region pinning, customer‑approved vendor list.

Technical

- Cache correctness (stale or unsafe reuse).
  - Mitigation: TTLs, semantic thresholds, safety tags to bypass cache, A/B validation.
- Provider outages and drift in model quality.
  - Mitigation: health checks, fallback order, periodic quality evals.
- Budget caps breaking critical paths.
  - Mitigation: tiered budgets (critical vs non‑critical), soft caps with approvals before hard stops.

Operational

- Configuration sprawl across many apps.
  - Mitigation: templates, per‑team defaults, config UI with versioned policies.

### Glossary (simple)

- TTL: Time To Live—how long a cached item is valid.
- Circuit breaker: Automatically stop or reroute when errors spike.
- Similarity threshold: How close two prompts must be to reuse a cached answer.
