## Idea 9 — AI Release Notes + Changelog Builder (PRs/issues to customer-facing notes)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- AI Release Notes + Changelog Builder (PRs/issues to customer‑facing notes)
- Who: Product/engineering teams shipping weekly/bi‑weekly releases.
- MVP: Connect to GitHub/Azure DevOps/Jira, summarize PRs/issues into customer‑friendly notes with categories, impact, and highlights; export to Markdown/HTML.
- Pricing: $200–$1,000/mo.
- Validate: 3 products; PM feedback; publish two cycles.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Writing release notes is like turning a pile of developer changes into a short, friendly story for customers. This tool reads pull requests, commits, and tickets and drafts the notes for you.
- It groups changes (new, improved, fixed, security), removes jargon, and adds highlights. You can edit, approve, and publish to your website or docs.
- It also remembers your tone and standard sections, and links to docs or migration guides when needed.
- The result: consistent, clear notes every release with less PM time and fewer mistakes.

Key terms (simple)

- PR (Pull Request): A bundle of code changes proposed for merge.
- Changelog: A log of what changed between releases.
- Taxonomy: The categories used to organize notes (e.g., Added, Changed, Fixed).

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 teams that publish notes manually and ship at least bi‑weekly.
- Interview PMs/Dev leads: sources of truth (GitHub/ADO/Jira), pain points (time, tone consistency), compliance needs (security advisories), and preferred output (Markdown/HTML/Docs site).
- Baseline: hours per release spent on notes; missed items; edits after publish.
- Confirm must‑haves: SSO (GitHub/Azure AD), repo/project scopes, templates per product, approvals, preview links.

Competitive scan

- Conventional changelog scripts and GitHub release notes
  - Pros: free, automatic.
  - Cons: too technical; poor categorization; not customer‑friendly.
- Docs automation tools and AI summarizers
  - Pros: draft faster.
  - Cons: generic; weak taxonomy control; limited multi‑repo aggregation.
- Manual PM process
  - Pros: tailored tone.
  - Cons: slow and error‑prone; inconsistent.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Opinionated taxonomy + templates tuned for customer‑facing clarity; multi‑repo aggregation; Jira tie‑in for features/epics; security advisory support.
- Lightweight workflow: draft → review → publish; exports to Markdown/HTML and docs platforms.

Why now

- Frequent releases and multi‑repo setups make manual notes painful. LLM summarization plus rules can save hours and improve quality.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Save PM time,” “Consistent tone,” “Fewer missed items,” “Easy publishing to site/docs.”
- Market state: Many scripts; few tools that produce customer‑quality notes with templates and multi‑source aggregation.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Scripts are fast but crude; manual is high‑quality but slow. You deliver quality with speed and repeatability.
- Why try it: In two release cycles, show 60–80% time saved and higher stakeholder satisfaction.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Pick 5–10 candidate repos/products; map their release cadence and sources.
- [ ] Baseline: hours spent, quality issues, tone guidelines, mandatory sections (security, breaking changes).
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Draft coverage ≥ 80% of shipped items
  - [ ] Edits < 20% after review
  - [ ] Publish flow to Markdown/HTML works for two cycles

Phase 1: MVP build (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Connectors: GitHub/ADO/Jira read scopes; filter by labels/milestones.
- [ ] Drafting: summarize PR titles/descriptions, linked issues, commit messages; categorize by taxonomy.
- [ ] Templates: per‑product sections, tone controls, links to docs.
- [ ] Review UI: diff of drafted vs approved; comments; approver roles.
- [ ] Export: Markdown/HTML; optional Docusaurus/Docs integration.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Run for 2–3 consecutive releases on 2 products.
- [ ] Collect editor feedback; tune taxonomy and templates.
- [ ] Add security advisory and breaking change callouts.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing tiers: Starter ($200/mo, 1 product), Pro ($500/mo, up to 5), Enterprise ($1k+/mo) with SSO and advanced templates.
- [ ] Onboarding: connect repos/projects, set taxonomy and templates, choose outputs.
- [ ] Security docs: read‑only scopes, retention, audit logs.
- [ ] Case study: time saved and quality scores.

Simple tracker (columns)

- Product | Repos | Cadence | Draft coverage % | Edit % | Time saved | Publish target | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Small teams may DIY.
  - Mitigation: low‑cost Starter tier; highlight time saved and quality.

Legal/compliance

- Security advisories must be accurate.
  - Mitigation: separate, approved advisory blocks; mandatory human review.

Technical

- Noisy commit messages or poor PR hygiene.
  - Mitigation: rely on linked issues; label conventions; allow manual curation.

Operational

- Template drift across products.
  - Mitigation: shared template library with overrides; change control.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Milestone: A set of issues/PRs targeting a release.
- Advisory: A notice about security fixes or risks.
- Diff: The difference between two versions of text or code.
