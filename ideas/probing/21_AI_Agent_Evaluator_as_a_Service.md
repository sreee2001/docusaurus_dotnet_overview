## Idea 21 — AI Agent Evaluator‑as‑a‑Service

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- AI Agent Evaluator‑as‑a‑Service
- Who: Teams deploying LLM agents.
- MVP: Test harness to run agents against scenarios, guardrails, and regression suites with scoring and diffs.
- Pricing: $500–$2,000/mo.
- Validate: One team’s agent suite; improvements in reliability and regressions caught.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- When you change your AI agent, you want to know if it still works. This tool runs a set of tests on the agent and shows what got better or worse.
- It catches mistakes early and helps you ship with confidence.

Key terms (simple)

- Regression test: A test that checks old features still work after a change.
- Guardrails: Rules to keep the agent safe and on‑policy.
- Scenario: A repeatable situation to test an agent.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 5 platform leads; inventory agent types, current testing gaps, metrics (success, cost, latency), and security policies.
- Baseline: failure modes, on‑call incidents due to agent changes.
- Must‑haves: scenario authoring, golden outputs, cost/latency tracking, CI integration.

Competitive scan

- Eval tools/frameworks (OpenAI Evals, Promptfoo, Ragas)
  - Pros: building blocks.
  - Cons: not turnkey, limited CI and multi‑agent orchestration.
- In‑house scripts
  - Pros: tailored.
  - Cons: inconsistent, hard to maintain.

Your wedge (advantages)

- CI‑friendly, opinionated evaluator focused on agents, with regression diffs and budget/latency metrics.

Why now

- Agent complexity grows; shipping without regression tests is risky.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Catch regressions,” “Quantify quality/cost,” “Automate checks in CI.”
- Market: Fragmented DIY; you provide a clean, CI‑ready service.
- Why try: 1‑week setup to cover top scenarios and guardrails; early wins visible in PRs.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (3–5 days)

- [ ] Catalog agent flows; define success metrics and guardrails.
- [ ] Select 10–20 core scenarios; create golden outputs.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Scenario runner; metrics capture (success, tokens, p95 latency).
- [ ] Diff viewer; budget gates; CI integration; minimal dashboard.

Phase 2: Pilot (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Run in pre‑merge and nightly; track regressions caught and MTTR.
- [ ] Iterate scenarios and thresholds.

Phase 3: Rollout (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $500–$2,000/mo; onboarding templates.
- [ ] Optional: load testing and safety probes (prompt injection, PII leaks).

Simple tracker

- Scenario | Owner | Success | Cost | p95 | Diff | Gate pass? | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: teams may defer until late → offer “free baseline” and show early incidents avoided.
- Legal: data in test prompts → sanitize and BYOC storage.
- Technical: model/provider variance → adapters and seeded randomness controls.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Golden output: The expected answer for a scenario.
- Budget gate: A limit that blocks changes if cost/latency is too high.
- MTTR: Mean time to recovery from failures.

Continuing unattended in Normal mode.
