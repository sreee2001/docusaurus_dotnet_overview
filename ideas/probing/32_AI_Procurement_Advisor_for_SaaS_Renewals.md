## Idea 32 — AI Procurement Advisor for SaaS Renewals

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- AI Procurement Advisor for SaaS Renewals
- Who: Finance/Procurement teams handling SaaS renewals.
- MVP: Parse renewal notices, pull usage/spend, flag term changes, and suggest negotiation tactics and approval paths.
- Pricing: $1,000–$3,000/mo.
- Validate: One renewal cycle; documented savings or improved terms.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Vendors email when contracts are about to renew. This advisor reads the email, checks actual usage and spend, and recommends what to do.
- It drafts replies, suggests negotiation levers, and sets up approvals in Teams.

Key terms (simple)

- True‑up: Adjust licenses to actual usage.
- MSA: Master Service Agreement.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 5 procurement leads; list top vendors, data sources (SSO logs, expense), and approval workflows.
- Baseline: savings %, missed deadlines, negotiation outcomes.
- Must‑haves: mailbox intake, usage/spend connectors, policy templates, approvals.

Competitive scan

- Spend mgmt/CLM tools
  - Pros: data and contracts.
  - Cons: limited renewal triage and advisor workflows.
- Manual email+spreadsheets
  - Pros: flexible.
  - Cons: slow, missed leverage.

Your wedge (advantages)

Why now

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Hit renewal dates,” “Pay for what we use,” “Negotiate better,” “Fewer emails.”
- Market: Many tools; renewal advisor angle is under‑served.
- Why try: Pilot one quarter; show savings and smoother approvals.
