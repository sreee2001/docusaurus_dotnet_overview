## Idea 12 — Sales Ops Inbox Copilot (Outlook + CRM)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Sales Ops Inbox Copilot (Outlook + CRM)
- Who: B2B sales orgs on Outlook + Dynamics 365 or Salesforce.
- MVP: Parse inbound leads from email, enrich (company, intent), auto‑route, create/update CRM records, and draft first replies.
- Pricing: $50–$150/user/mo.
- Validate: 3 reps; improve lead SLA and qualification rate.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Think of this as a smart assistant sitting in your sales inbox. When a new lead emails, it recognizes the lead, finds company info, and fills the CRM for you.
- It writes a first reply that matches your playbook (“Thanks for reaching out—here’s a quick answer and a link to book time”), so reps move faster.
- It routes messages to the right owner based on rules (territory, product, account tier), and flags high‑intent emails so they get quick attention.
- For managers, it keeps track of response times and lead quality, so you see what’s working right away.

Key terms (simple)

- Lead: A person or company that shows interest in your product.
- Enrichment: Add data about the lead (industry, size, tech stack) from external sources.
- SLA: Service Level Agreement—your target time to respond.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 B2B teams using Outlook + Dynamics/Salesforce with dedicated inbound inboxes (e.g., sales@, info@, demo@).
- Interview RevOps/Sales managers: current lead flow, tools (Power Automate, Outreach, SalesLoft), SLA targets, routing rules, enrichment sources.
- Baseline: average time‑to‑first‑response (TTFR), lead qualification rate, percent of inbox emails that become CRM leads, manual data entry time per lead.
- Confirm must‑haves: SSO, audit trail, CRM field mapping, territory rules, consent/compliance (GDPR), opt‑out handling.

Competitive scan

- CRM native lead capture (Dynamics/HubSpot/Salesforce Web‑to‑Lead)
  - Pros: integrated, simple forms.
  - Cons: email parsing is weak; manual inbox handling persists; limited AI routing.
- Sales engagement tools (Outreach, SalesLoft, Copilot features)
  - Pros: sequencing and templates.
  - Cons: still rely on reps to parse emails and update CRM; limited inbox triage.
- Power Automate/Flow + custom scripts
  - Pros: quick to start.
  - Cons: brittle parsing; poor enrichment; hard to maintain routing logic.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Outlook‑native ingestion with robust parsing, high‑quality enrichment, and precise CRM mapping; strong routing engine with territory/product rules.
- Drafted replies aligned to playbooks with manager‑approved templates; measurable SLA improvements.

Why now

- Inbound email volume is rising; reps lose time to data entry and slow routing. A small boost in TTFR and quality has outsized revenue impact.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Faster first reply,” “No more manual CRM entry,” “Smart routing,” “Better visibility on lead quality.”
- Market state: Plenty of sales tools, but inbox parsing + CRM creation + quality enrichment + drafted replies in one flow is rare.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Native CRM is simple but shallow for email; engagement tools don’t fix inbox/CRM plumbing; scripts are fragile. You offer a cohesive, Outlook‑first pipeline.
- Why try it: In two weeks, show reduced TTFR, higher qualification rates, and happier reps.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Select 6–8 candidate teams with a shared inbound mailbox and defined territories.
- [ ] Baseline: TTFR, qualification %, manual entry time/lead, enrichment sources (Clearbit, 6sense, LinkedIn), and existing routing rules.
- [ ] Define MVP acceptance criteria:
  - [ ] Reduce TTFR by ≥ 30%
  - [ ] Increase qualification rate by ≥ 10%
  - [ ] Cut manual entry time by ≥ 50%
- [ ] Confirm data privacy, consent/opt‑out handling, and CRM field mapping.

Phase 1: MVP build (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Ingestion & parsing:
  - [ ] Microsoft Graph for mailbox; extract sender, signature, company, phone; simple entity extraction
  - [ ] Attachments: parse PDFs/VCFs for contact details; block unsafe
- [ ] Enrichment:
  - [ ] Plug into chosen providers; fallbacks; confidence scores; GDPR‑aware usage
- [ ] CRM integration:
  - [ ] Create/update Lead/Contact/Account; dedupe by domain/email; map owner via territory rules
  - [ ] Log email in CRM; link to opportunity if present
- [ ] Draft reply:
  - [ ] Templates per intent (demo request, pricing, support misroute); include Calendly/Bookings link
  - [ ] Confidence threshold + human review option
- [ ] Routing & rules:
  - [ ] Territory/product/ABM lists; round‑robin; after‑hours fallback
- [ ] Observability & compliance:
  - [ ] SLA timers, audit logs, PII redaction in logs, opt‑out handling

Phase 2: Pilot (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Run in shadow mode for 1 week; compare parsed vs human entries; fix rules.
- [ ] Enable create/update in CRM with limited scope; draft replies for top intents.
- [ ] Weekly report: TTFR change, qualification %, enrichment accuracy, rep feedback.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–4 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing: $50–$150/user/mo; minimums for small teams; discount annual.
- [ ] Onboarding: mailbox access, CRM scopes, territory config, templates, enrichment keys.
- [ ] Security docs: data flows, redaction, opt‑out compliance (GDPR/CCPA), DPA.
- [ ] Case study: TTFR improvement and pipeline impact.

Simple tracker (columns)

- Team | Mailbox | CRM | TTFR (before/after) | Qual % (before/after) | Manual mins/lead | Enrichment provider | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- Small teams may not justify per‑user pricing.
  - Mitigation: team‑based pricing tiers; ROI calculators; bundle with outreach templates.

Legal/compliance

- GDPR/CCPA on enrichment and contact emails.
  - Mitigation: consent checks; opt‑out link handling; data minimization; DPA.

Technical

- Parsing errors and false positives.
  - Mitigation: shadow mode, confidence thresholds, easy corrections pushed back to CRM.
- CRM API limits and dedupe edge‑cases.
  - Mitigation: rate limiting, idempotency keys, robust dedupe strategy.

Operational

- Template drift or off‑brand replies.
  - Mitigation: manager‑approved templates; periodic audits; A/B tests.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Territory: A rule that assigns leads to reps (by country, industry, or account list).
- Dedupe: Avoid creating duplicate CRM records.
- TTFR: Time To First Response—how fast a rep replies to a new lead.
