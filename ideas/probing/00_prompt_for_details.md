I need more information on all the presented Ideas

This is what I want you to do

# How

For each Idea,

- present the above idea
- exact text one more time,
- do what I want below
- get confirmation and move to next idea
- make sure you dont run out of output tokens: if you are about to , stop at an appropriate sub section, print left over tasks list in a small simple list and a -----To_Be_Continued----- text, that tell me you have more to giveme. Remember this checkpoint
- if I respond continue/go on , etc., continue to give me the rest of the response , Do this until completion

# What to do per idea

- Present the idea one more time:
- Present each Idea in a seperate section that I can copy into a markdown file
- Explain to me in 2 - 4 passages, Talk to me as if I am a 5th grader, You can use industry standard language and or acronyms. Just explain the words at the end of each idea
- Next talk about Research, Planning, gathering market data, learning about competetion, what I can do
- Now for this step, you are an researcher and salesman and you are pitching this idea to me.
- Use any and all presentation material and or reference charts and or analytics, to make me understand
  -- the target user needs
  -- tha market state
  -- current solutions, their pros and cons,
  -- my advantage over them ( if any! )
  -- why we should build this, and why they should atleast try my product
- Now walk me through, step by step, using checklists and any other form of tracker/planner, what I am supposed to do.
- Consider yourself as my personal assistant and will guide me and hand hold me at every stage
- Assume I know nothing about this
- Help me understand risks, financial and or legal

Once an idea is completely charted, provide a high level list of next 5 ideas you want to work on and depending on my selection, repeat the process

For now start with the First Idea
