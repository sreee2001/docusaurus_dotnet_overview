## Idea 25 — Red Team Prompt Security Service

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Red Team Prompt Security Service
- Who: Security teams and platform owners exposing LLMs.
- MVP: Prompt‑injection and data‑exfil tests, safety probes, reports with fixes and retest gates.
- Pricing: $5,000 per engagement or $1,000/mo subscription.
- Validate: One assessment with clear findings and remediations implemented.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- This service “attacks” your AI like a hacker would—using tricky prompts to make it break rules.
- You get a clear report of what went wrong and how to fix it, then we retest.

Key terms (simple)

- Prompt injection: A message that tricks the AI into ignoring its rules.
- Data exfiltration: Getting the AI to reveal secrets.
- Red team: A friendly attacker who finds weaknesses before real attackers do.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 10 orgs with LLM apps; catalog use cases, data types, existing guardrails, and incident history.
- Baseline: current tests, policies, and blocking controls.
- Must‑haves: test catalog, reproducible probes, severity scoring, and CI gates.

Competitive scan

- Security consultancies
  - Pros: expertise.
  - Cons: not LLM‑specific; tests vary.
- DIY checklists
  - Pros: cheap.
  - Cons: incomplete, hard to maintain.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Opinionated LLM security corpus + automated harness + concrete fixes and gates.

Why now

- Attacks are rising; regulators and buyers expect proof of safety testing.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Find weaknesses,” “Prove due diligence,” “Automate retests,” “Block regressions.”
- Market: Early; many teams lack LLM‑specific testing. You bring a repeatable program.
- Why try: Short engagement with clear ROI (findings fixed, gates added).

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Scoping (3–5 days)

- [ ] Inventory flows and sensitive data; define out‑of‑scope.
- [ ] Pick severity rubric and acceptable risk.

Phase 1: Testing (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Run injection/exfil probes; jailbreaks; tool‑abuse tests.
- [ ] Record repro steps; gather logs; compute severity and impact.

Phase 2: Remediation + Gates (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Provide fixes (filters, grounding, auth checks); add CI gates with sample tests.
- [ ] Retest; certify passing scope.

Packaging

- [ ] Report, evidence, and test pack; optional quarterly subscription.

Simple tracker

- Finding | Severity | Area | Fix | Owner | Status | Retest date | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: budget pushback → offer smaller scoped packs.
- Legal: consent/scope → strict rules and NDAs.
- Technical: model variance → seed control and multiple providers.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Jailbreak: Forcing an AI to ignore constraints.
- Harness: Test runner that automates checks.
- Gate: A rule that blocks deployment if tests fail.
