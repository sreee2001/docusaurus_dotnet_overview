## Idea 10 — Managed vLLM/Triton in AKS (BYOC model serving productized)

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Managed vLLM/Triton in AKS (BYOC model serving productized)
- Who: Eng/platform teams wanting on‑prem/in‑tenant inference.
- MVP: Helm deploy + autoscaling + metrics; approved model list; cost guardrails; run in customer’s AKS.
- Pricing: $1,500–$5,000/mo + setup.
- Validate: One model serving SLO in production.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- This is a “server in a box” for AI models inside a company’s Azure cloud. You give it a model, and it serves that model reliably with metrics and scaling.
- It supports vLLM (great for LLMs) and Triton (great for multiple AI frameworks), so teams can pick the right tool.
- It auto‑scales up when traffic grows and down when it’s quiet, watches performance, and keeps costs under control.
- Security and networking follow the company’s rules because it runs in their AKS cluster.

Key terms (simple)

- vLLM: A high‑performance inference server for large language models.
- Triton: NVIDIA’s inference server supporting many model types.
- Helm: A package manager for Kubernetes to install apps easily.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 8–12 teams needing private inference (PII, regulated data, low‑latency edge).
- Interview platform leads: GPU types available (L40S/A100), SLOs, models required (LLMs, vision), network rules, logging/monitoring standards, cost targets.
- Baseline: current serving stack, pain points (crashes, cold starts, cost, upgrades).
- Confirm must‑haves: SSO to dashboards, RBAC, audit logs, Private Link, cost caps, blue/green deploys.

Competitive scan

- Azure ML Endpoints / Bedrock / Vertex
  - Pros: managed, easy.
  - Cons: limited in‑tenant control, cost/egress, model restrictions.
- Anyscale/Modal/Replicate
  - Pros: frictionless.
  - Cons: hosted; data egress concerns; variable enterprise features.
- DIY Helm charts
  - Pros: tailored.
  - Cons: fragile; missing guardrails; ops heavy.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Enterprise‑grade templates (autoscaling, metrics, budgets, RBAC) + approved model catalog; AKS‑first with Azure networking patterns.
- Faster time‑to‑prod vs DIY; safer than hosted for sensitive data.

Why now

- Teams want control and speed without rebuilding infra. GPUs are costly; autoscaling and observability make a big difference.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Target user needs: “Run models safely in our tenant,” “Meet SLOs,” “Keep GPU costs down,” “Upgrade without surprises.”
- Market state: Many hosted options; fewer turnkey AKS‑native templates with governance and model catalog.
- Alternatives trade‑offs: Hosted is quick but risky for data and spend; DIY is safe but slow. You deliver speed with control.
- Why try it: Deploy a production model with metrics and autoscaling in one week.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Confirm AKS version, GPU nodes, regions, networking rules (Private Link/Firewall).
- [ ] Define SLO (p95 latency, uptime) and budgets.
- [ ] Choose initial model(s) and traffic estimates.

Phase 1: MVP build (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Helm charts for vLLM/Triton with values for model path, tokenizer, quantization.
- [ ] Autoscaling (KEDA/HPA) on QPS/latency; warm pool for cold‑start protection.
- [ ] Metrics (Prometheus) and dashboards (Grafana); logs (Loki); alerts (Teams/Email).
- [ ] Budgets & safeguards: max replicas, GPU spend alerts, circuit breakers.
- [ ] Network: private ingress, WAF, allowlists; TLS and cert rotation.

Phase 2: Pilot (1–2 weeks)

- [ ] Deploy one model to staging; load test to SLO; tune autoscaling.
- [ ] Blue/green to prod; canary 10% traffic; measure p95 and error rates.
- [ ] Weekly report: latency, throughput, costs, incidents.

Phase 3: Packaging & rollout (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing tiers: by number of models/endpoints and support level.
- [ ] Onboarding: cluster checks, IAM, storage for models, network config, dashboards.
- [ ] Security docs: RBAC, audit logs, data paths, retention.
- [ ] Case study: SLO met and cost per token improved.

Simple tracker (columns)

- Model | GPU | p95 target | p95 achieved | QPS | Autoscale min/max | Cost/day | Incidents | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

Financial

- GPU underutilization.
  - Mitigation: aggressive scale‑to‑zero; batch windows; right‑size SKUs.

Legal/compliance

- Model/data licensing and retention.
  - Mitigation: approved model list; license scans; data retention controls.

Technical

- Cold starts and VRAM limits.
  - Mitigation: warm pools; quantization; sharding; tokenizer caching.

Operational

- Upgrade churn.
  - Mitigation: versioned charts; blue/green; rollback procedures.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- KEDA/HPA: Kubernetes autoscaling based on events/metrics.
- Blue/green: Run new and old versions side‑by‑side, switch traffic when ready.
- Quantization: Make models smaller/faster with minimal accuracy loss.
