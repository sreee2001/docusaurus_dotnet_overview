## Idea 29 — AI‑Backed SLA Breach Predictor

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- AI‑Backed SLA Breach Predictor
- Who: ITSM owners for helpdesks and operations teams.
- MVP: Predict SLA breaches from ticket metadata, sentiment, and workload; send early alerts and playbook suggestions.
- Pricing: $1,000–$3,000/mo.
- Validate: Precision/recall on historical data and reduced breaches in a pilot.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Before a ticket is late, this tool predicts risk and warns the team.
- It suggests steps to prevent the breach, like reassigning or escalating.

Key terms (simple)

- SLA: A target response/resolve time.
- Precision/recall: Measures of prediction quality.
- Playbook: A set of steps to resolve an issue.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 4 ITSM leads; gather ticket schemas, SLAs, and historical performance.
- Baseline: current breach rates, drivers (queue, priority, sentiment).
- Must‑haves: model transparency, override controls, alert routing.

Competitive scan

- ITSM suites with analytics
  - Pros: embedded.
  - Cons: generic models, limited proactivity.
- DIY notebooks
  - Pros: tailored.
  - Cons: hard to operationalize.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Proactive alerts with explainable factors and simple playbooks; integrates with ServiceNow/Jira.

Why now

- Ticket volumes are rising; preventing breaches has clear ROI.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Fewer breaches,” “Proactive alerts,” “Explainable insights,” “Easy integration.”
- Market: Analytics exist; proactive, explainable predictors are rare.
- Why try: Pilot with measurable reduction in breaches.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Data access; define SLAs; agree on metrics and success thresholds.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Feature engineering (age, priority, backlog, sentiment); baseline model; alerting.
- [ ] Explanations (SHAP‑like); override UI; feedback loop.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Shadow mode; evaluate precision/recall; tune thresholds.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $1k–$3k/mo; onboarding and security docs.
- [ ] Optional: workforce planning suggestions.

Simple tracker

- Team | Volume | Breach rate | Precision | Recall | Alerts | Prevented | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: data wrangling costs → fixed‑fee onboarding.
- Legal: personal data in tickets → anonymize; BYOC.
- Technical: model drift → retraining cadence and monitoring.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- SHAP: A method to explain model predictions.
- Shadow mode: Run predictions silently to measure accuracy.
- Threshold: The cutoff for alerting.
