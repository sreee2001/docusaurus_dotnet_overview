## Idea 24 — ETL to LLM Guarded Connectors

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- ETL to LLM Guarded Connectors
- Who: Enterprise IT/data teams exposing SharePoint/Dataverse/SQL data to LLMs.
- MVP: Safe, policy‑enforced data connectors with row/column‑level security, masking, and audit for LLM/RAG pipelines.
- Pricing: $500–$2,000 per connector/mo.
- Validate: One connector live; policy tests pass; no data leakage in trials.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Connectors move data from business systems to AI tools. This one adds guardrails so only the right rows and columns are shared.
- It hides sensitive fields (like SSNs) and logs who accessed what.
- You can safely power chatbots and copilots without breaking data policies.

Key terms (simple)

- Connector: A bridge that moves data between systems.
- Row/column‑level security: Rules about which rows/columns a user can see.
- Masking: Hiding sensitive values while keeping data shape.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Meet 5 IT owners; list top sources (SharePoint, Dataverse, SQL), data policies, and RBAC models.
- Baseline: how data is shared today, incidents/near‑misses, audit needs.
- Must‑haves: per‑user permissions passthrough, PII masking, audit trail, deny‑by‑default.

Competitive scan

- Native connectors (Graph/Power Platform)
  - Pros: supported; broad.
  - Cons: coarse controls; limited masking/audit for LLM use.
- iPaaS tools
  - Pros: many endpoints.
  - Cons: general‑purpose; lack fine‑grained LLM policies.

Your wedge (advantages)

- LLM‑first policies (purpose binding, field‑level masking, prompt‑context audit) with M365 identity passthrough.

Why now

- Enterprises want AI but must meet strict data policies; guardrails unblock adoption.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “No leaks,” “Least privilege,” “Full audit,” “Easy to integrate.”
- Market: Many connectors, few with LLM‑grade policy control; your product fills the gap.
- Why try: Pilot one high‑value dataset with zero policy violations and usable logs.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Choose source and target (SharePoint → RAG store); map RBAC and sensitive fields.
- [ ] Define policies (mask, block, transform) and audit needs.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Connector with per‑user access checks; field masking; purpose binding tag.
- [ ] Audit logging; deny‑by‑default; backpressure controls.
- [ ] Tests: policy unit tests + red team prompts.

Phase 2: Pilot (2 weeks)

- [ ] Run read‑only; verify no violations; review logs with security.
- [ ] Enable read→RAG publish; validate downstream access.

Phase 3: Rollout (ongoing)

- [ ] Pricing per connector; onboarding guide; SOC2‑friendly docs.

Simple tracker

- Source | Fields masked | Users | Policies | Violations | Last audit | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: niche budgets → package with RAG projects.
- Legal: PII mishandling → default‑deny and encryption; BYOC option.
- Technical: identity passthrough complexity → start with M365/Entra ID and expand.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Purpose binding: Limit data use to a specific purpose.
- Backpressure: Slow intake to avoid overload.
- BYOC: Run in the customer’s cloud account.
