## Idea 26 — Contact Center QA Copilot (Teams Phone)

- Contact Center QA Copilot (Teams Phone)
- Who: Support/contact center teams using Teams Phone or integrated CCaaS.
- MVP: Summarize calls, score against QA rubrics, highlight coaching moments, and track trends.
- Pricing: $50/agent/mo.
- Validate: 100 calls; QA acceptance and improved coaching outcomes.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Talk to 5 support leads; capture scoring rubrics, tools (Teams/Genesys/Five9), and constraints.
- Baseline: time to score a call, agent coaching cadence, CSAT.
- Must‑haves: consent/recording handling, redaction, role‑based access.

Competitive scan

- CCaaS analytics add‑ons
  - Pros: integrated.
  - Cons: generic scoring; limited Teams Phone focus.
- Manual QA sampling
  - Pros: human judgment.
  - Cons: slow; limited coverage.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Teams‑first, rubric‑driven scoring with explainable evidence and coaching workflows.

Why now

- Hybrid support teams need better coverage and coaching without big platform switches.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Score more calls,” “Consistent standards,” “Actionable coaching,” “Improve CSAT.”
- Market: Analytics exists, Teams Phone coverage varies; your focus brings simplicity.
- Why try: Pilot 100 calls; improve QA throughput and coaching acceptance.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Define rubric and data sources; agree on consent and retention.
- [ ] Identify outcomes to track (CSAT, AHT, QA pass rate).

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Transcript ingestion; summarization; rubric scoring with evidence snippets.
- [ ] Dashboard; agent/manager views; coaching queue.
- [ ] PII redaction; access controls.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Run on 100 calls; compare manual vs auto scores.
- [ ] Iterate rubric mapping and UI.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $50/agent/mo; onboarding; security docs.
- [ ] Optional: real‑time hints for live calls.

Simple tracker

- Call | Agent | Score | Key issues | Coaching items | CSAT | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: budget limits → tiered pricing by coverage.
- Legal: call consent and PII → enforce consent and redaction.
- Technical: integration diversity → start with Teams + one CCaaS.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- AHT: Average Handle Time.
- CSAT: Customer Satisfaction.
- Redaction: Removing sensitive info from transcripts.
