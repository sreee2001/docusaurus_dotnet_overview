I am a developer. I can code
I am an software architect. I can design software at all levels
I am a manager. I can lead people

I can invest 30 - 40 hours every week outside my main jor, during the build phase, then full time on this , once profit starts to be north of 150K per annum

What ideas do you have that I can do to create a business.

- End Goal and software could be different from the start point
- I want to start small, test reliability at every stagem marketability and competetion and tune
- Eventually launch, survive, raise profits or VC, then go big scale
- Can Hire others once I setup the infrastructure ( aka , hardware, domains, websites, legal structure ...)

Which 5 to prioritize (based on your skills/time/budget)

- P1: Outlook→ServiceNow triage agent (extend SentinelBridge). Fastest to market in Microsoft/ServiceNow shops.
- P2: Teams Incident Commander Bot. Clear ROI, sticky with SREs.
- P3: BYOC Private AI Runtime. Medium build, strong enterprise pull; start as pro services + template.
- P4: Generative KB + Auto-Reply for Helpdesk. Demonstrable deflection ROI.
- P5: FinOps for AI Spend. High-need, easy to wedge in.

90-day launch path (example for P1 triage + P2 incident bot)

- Weeks 1–2: Customer discovery (10 IT leaders), confirm pains and procurement.
- Weeks 3–4: MVP for triage (email ingest, classification, SN create/update, Teams notify). Pilot with 1–2 design partners.
- Weeks 5–6: Add Teams bot with incident flows; basic admin UI; billing (Stripe).
- Weeks 7–8: Hardening, SSO, budget caps, logs, audit. Draft security doc. Lighthouse case study.
- Weeks 9–12: Paid pilots (3–5 orgs). Iterate on features that reduce time-to-resolution. Start repeatable deployment docs.

Costs (fit to your budget)

- Month 1–3:
  - Infra (dev): $100–$300/mo (App Service/AKS small, DB, logging) if hosted; $100–$200 for control-plane if BYOC.
  - Domains/Email/O365 dev: $20–$60/mo.
  - Legal LLC + basic terms/privacy: $500–$2,000 one-time.
- Optional one-time: $2–10k for compliance prep, logo/site, initial marketing.
- Scale later to $2–4k/mo as you add pilots; push BYOC to limit your burn.

Risks and mitigation

- Market crowded: Choose a vertical wedge and measure ROI (MTTA, deflection).
- Security/compliance: Start with BYOC and least-privilege; document controls early.
- Sales cycle: Pick mid-market; price reasonably; offer setup package to shorten close.
- Support load: Build observability, simple UIs, and replayable pipelines from day one.

First concrete actions (this week)

- Pick 2–3 ideas (e.g., #1, #2, #9).
- Line up 5–10 discovery calls; draft one-pager and demo screenshots/wireframes.
- Build MVP of #1 using your existing SentinelBridge repo: email → classify → ServiceNow → Teams.
- Set up a simple landing page with a waitlist and Calendly.

I can help you:

- Flesh out the MVP scope and backlog for any 3 of the above.
- Draft a one-page sales sheet and landing page copy.
- Produce a 2–4 week implementation checklist per chosen idea, with metrics and contracts.
- Extend SentinelBridge into a productized offering (licensing, config UI, installers).

Which 2–3 ideas do you want to explore first? If SentinelBridge is one, I’ll turn it into a sellable MVP (pricing, trials, onboarding, support playbook) and wire the Teams bot next.
