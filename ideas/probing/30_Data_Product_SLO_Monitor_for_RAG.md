## Idea 30 — Data Product SLO Monitor for RAG

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Data Product SLO Monitor for RAG
- Who: Data/platform teams owning RAG quality and freshness.
- MVP: Track precision@k, latency, and corpus freshness SLOs with alerts and rollups by collection.
- Pricing: $500–$2,000/mo.
- Validate: One corpus with real SLOs; alerts reduce regressions.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- RAG answers depend on good data and fast retrieval. This tool watches those signals and alerts when they dip.
- It shows which collections are stale or slow so you can fix them before users notice.

Key terms (simple)

- SLO: A target level of service (e.g., 95% precision@5, p95 latency < 1s).
- Freshness: How up-to-date your indexed documents are.
- Collection: A group of documents powering a use case.

---

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Meet 4 data platform leads; list metrics used today and gaps.
- Baseline: precision and latency vs expectations; missed SLAs; stale data incidents.
- Must‑haves: evaluation sets, synthetic queries, latency histograms, freshness tracking, alerts.

Competitive scan

- APM/log tools
  - Pros: infra metrics.
  - Cons: limited RAG‑specific quality metrics.
- DIY dashboards
  - Pros: tailored.
  - Cons: fragile and incomplete.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Opinionated RAG SLOs with easy instrumentation and dashboards.

Why now

- RAG is moving to production; teams need reliability metrics.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Know quality,” “Catch regressions,” “Meet SLAs,” “Explain issues.”
- Market: Horizontal tools miss RAG specifics; you bring focused SLOs.
- Why try: Quick win on one corpus; prevent a visible incident.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Define SLOs and initial eval sets; map ingestion cadence.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] SDK for logging queries/latency; eval runner for precision; freshness index.
- [ ] Dashboards and alerts; SLO rollups by collection.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Run on one corpus; tune thresholds; document runbooks.

Phase 3: Rollout (ongoing)

- [ ] Pricing as above; onboarding; BYOC option.

Simple tracker

- Collection | Precision@k | p95 latency | Freshness | Alert state | Owner | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: seen as “nice to have” → tie to incident prevention.
- Legal: data logging → anonymize and limit payloads.
- Technical: eval set drift → update cadence and versioning.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Eval set: Labeled queries/answers used to measure quality.
- Histogram: A chart showing distribution (e.g., latencies).
- Rollup: An aggregated view across items.
