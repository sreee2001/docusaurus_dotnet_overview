## Idea 16 — Manufacturing Quality Incident Agent

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Manufacturing Quality Incident Agent
- Who: Plant ops/quality teams.
- MVP: Classify defect/quality reports from email/forms, create tickets, notify owners, trend analysis.
- Pricing: $1,500+/plant/mo.
- Validate: One line; defect resolution time improvement.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- When someone reports a defect or quality issue, this agent files it correctly, alerts the right owner, and tracks resolution.
- It groups similar issues to find patterns (by line, SKU, shift) and suggests checks.
- Managers see trends and hotspots on a simple dashboard.
- Faster fixes, fewer repeats.

Key terms (simple)

- SKU: Product identifier.
- Pareto: A chart showing the biggest contributors to a problem.
- CAPA: Corrective and Preventive Actions.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Identify 6 plants/lines; capture current incident intake, ticketing, and reporting.
- Baseline: time to acknowledge/resolve; repeat defect rate.
- Must‑haves: offline forms, shift handoff notes, export to CSV.

Competitive scan

- MES/QMS systems
  - Pros: deep integration.
  - Cons: expensive; slow to modify; email intake poor.
- Spreadsheets + email
  - Pros: familiar.
  - Cons: messy data; bad analytics; slow alerts.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Lightweight intake with fast alerts, good analytics, and exports; integrates with existing MES/QMS later.

Why now

- Quality and throughput pressures are high; quick wins from better intake and triage.

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Catch defects quickly,” “See patterns,” “Reduce repeats,” “Keep operators in the loop.”
- Market: Heavy systems exist but are slow to adapt. Your agent brings speed and clarity without a rip‑and‑replace.
- Why try: Pilot on one line and show MTTR drop and repeat‑defect reduction.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Map lines/SKUs/shifts; define incident categories and owners.
- [ ] Baseline MTTA/MTTR and repeat rates.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Intake (email/web form); classification; ticket creation; Teams/SMS alerts.
- [ ] Dashboard (Pareto by category/SKU/shift); trend lines; export.
- [ ] Offline capture app (optional) for shop floor.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] One line; measure response/resolution; gather operator feedback.
- [ ] Iterate alerts and categories.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $1.5k+/plant/mo; onboarding kit.
- [ ] Security docs: data handling; user roles.

Simple tracker

- Line | SKU | Category | Shift | MTTA | MTTR | Repeat? | Owner | Status | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: small plants balk at price → offer per‑line pricing and ROI cases.
- Legal: worker data privacy → minimal personal data; consent policies.
- Technical: integration with MES/QMS → export CSV and phased API integration.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- MTTA/MTTR: Time to acknowledge/resolve.
- MES/QMS: Manufacturing/Quality systems.
- SMS: Text messages for alerts.
