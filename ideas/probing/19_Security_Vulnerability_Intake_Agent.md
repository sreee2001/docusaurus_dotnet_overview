## Idea 19 — Security Vulnerability Intake Agent

Exact text (as presented earlier)

- Security Vulnerability Intake Agent
- Who: Security teams (AppSec, product security).
- MVP: Parse vulnerability reports from email/portals, deduplicate, score (CVSS/severity), open tickets in Jira/ServiceNow, and notify owners.
- Pricing: $1,000–$4,000/mo.
- Validate: One bug bounty program or security inbox; time to triage and fix.

### Explain it simply (2–4 short passages)

- Security teams get many vulnerability reports. This agent reads them, checks if they’re real, groups duplicates, and creates the right tickets with all the details.
- It alerts the right developers and tracks status until fixed, giving leaders a clear view of risk.

Key terms (simple)

- CVSS: A standard way to score vulnerability severity.
- Triage: Decide if a report is valid and how urgent it is.
- Bug bounty: A program where researchers report security bugs for rewards.

### Research, planning, market, and competition

Research checklist

- Interview 4 AppSec leads; capture sources (HackerOne/Intigriti/email), volume, current triage, and SLAs.
- Baseline: time to triage, duplicates, time to fix by severity.
- Must‑haves: dedupe, CVSS scoring, asset mapping, Jira/ServiceNow integration, disclosure workflows.

Competitive scan

- Bug bounty platforms
  - Pros: intake and workflow.
  - Cons: limited integration/customization; internal vuln reports via email remain messy.
- Homegrown scripts + spreadsheets
  - Pros: tailored.
  - Cons: brittle, poor reporting, no ML dedupe.

Your wedge (advantages)

- Unified inbox for internal and external sources with strong dedupe and routing; integrates with existing ticketing.

Why now

- App footprints are growing; teams are lean; faster triage reduces risk exposure.

---

### A persuasive pitch (researcher + salesperson)

- Needs: “Faster triage,” “Fewer duplicates,” “Clear ownership,” “Risk visibility.”
- Market: Platforms exist but leave gaps; your agent fills them and plays nicely with existing tools.
- Why try: 2‑week pilot to cut triage time and reduce duplicate noise.

### Step-by-step plan (with checklists and trackers)

Phase 0: Discovery (1 week)

- [ ] Map sources and SLAs; define fields for tickets and CVSS mapping.
- [ ] Establish disclosure policies and templates.

Phase 1: MVP build (2 weeks)

- [ ] Classifier for vuln types; dedupe logic; CVSS scoring helper.
- [ ] Ticket creation; Teams/Slack notifications; status sync back.
- [ ] Dashboard: triage time, open by severity, duplicates.

Phase 2: Pilot (2–3 weeks)

- [ ] Enable on one source; measure triage time and duplicates.
- [ ] Iterate parsing and routing.

Phase 3: Rollout (2 weeks)

- [ ] Pricing $1k–$4k/mo; onboarding and security doc.
- [ ] Optional: exploitability hints and remediation suggestions for common vulns.

Simple tracker

- Report | Product | Severity | Owner | Status | SLA | Duplicate? | Notes

### Risks (financial, legal, technical)

- Financial: smaller orgs may rely on bounty platforms only → position as internal+external unifier.
- Legal: disclosure handling → templates and approval steps.
- Technical: dedupe accuracy → layered approaches (hashes, similarity, metadata), human override.

---

### Glossary (simple)

- Severity: How bad a vulnerability is and how quickly to fix it.
- SLA: Target time to acknowledge/fix based on severity.
- Remediation: The fix for the vulnerability.
