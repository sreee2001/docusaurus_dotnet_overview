1. List me different subjects available for EMBA program
2. Next for each subject do the following

a. provide a list of tools I can use for what purpose in my education

- examples, extract text reliable and accurately from images, pdf, emages embedded in pdf
- read ebooks, pdf and or other text and extract relevant data for my purpose that I will need
- Research in the internet to gather live data from the websites, and provide me with a dataset of information needed. Eg. for a venture capital course, I need to investigate current market data, get financial information and stage of startop it is in, and other live data. Data has to be accurate (most important), live (latest),
  analyzed and properly presented for later use

Rules:

- You are allowed to use any modern, professional jagron and or acronyms where needed. But- present definitions right after the section so I can refer what the word is
- Explain in high level , full sentences
- Talk to me as if I am a super smart 5th grader. I dont shy from latest jagron as long as you provide me definitions
- walk me through in detail in stages
- I want you to consider your output token limit. If you think you are nearing the limit, stop at the closest section. Remember this checkmark.

- You have all the information needed from me.
- Do not stop untill you finished the task in the entirety
